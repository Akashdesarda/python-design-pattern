    "- Its a `Creational pattern` that defines an interface or a way to create objects but also lets the subclasses decide to alter the type of objects that will be created.\n",
    "- It provides a way to delegate the creation & usage of objects at different locations.\n",
    "- So the now the subclasses has power to decide the type of objects that will be created."

    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**`ELI5 Example`:** Imagine you own a toy factory that makes different types of toys: cars, dolls, and robots. Instead of directly creating each toy in your code, you have a special machine (Factory) that can create toys for you. This machine decides which type of toy to create based on some input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Technical Example`:** The Factory Method pattern helps you create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. Instead, you define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This way, the creation logic is encapsulated in a method in the factory class."
