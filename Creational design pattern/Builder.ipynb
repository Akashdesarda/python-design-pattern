    "\n",
    "- The Builder Design Pattern is a `Creational design pattern` that lets you construct complex objects step by step.\n",
    "- It allows the client code to pick & choose the parts they want to build the object, just like an modular approach.\n",
    "- It makes the code more clean to read and maintain.\n",
    "- One of best side benefit of this pattern is that it allows method chaining."

    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**`ELI5 Example`:** Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and you want to build a cool spaceship. Instead of dumping all the pieces together at once, you follow a series of easy, step-by-step instructions: first, you build the engine, then the cockpit, and finally, you attach the wings. Each step adds a part to your spaceship until you have one awesome complete creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basically what the Builder design pattern does. It helps you construct a complex object piece by piece, rather than trying to create the whole thing in one giant step. You have a \"builder\" that knows how to add each part (or configuration) in the right order, and once you're done, you get your final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Technical Example`:** PySpark uses this pattern very heavily, especially in SparkSession  & DataFrame API. It allows you to create customized SparkSession by choosing the configuration you want. It allows you to create a DataFrame by chaining multiple methods together. "

    "\n",
    "- The Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes has too `many parameters` to initialize. \n",
    "- It makes the code more readable and maintainable as it allows you to build the object step by step which represents actual `real world behavior`.\n",
    "- It allows you to create `different configurations` of an object by using the same construction code.\n",
    "- It promotes the `Single Responsibility Principle` by separating the construction process from the representation."
