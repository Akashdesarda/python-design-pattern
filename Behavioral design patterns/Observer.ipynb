    "\n",
    "- Observer is a `behavioral design pattern` that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.\n",
    "- Its provides a way to `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` to and from these notifications.\n",
    "- So that, when an object changes its state, all the objects that depend on it are `notified` and `updated` automatically.\n",
    "- This way the workload can be democratized between all the subscribers. This will improve the performance & efficiency of the system."

    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**`ELI5 Example`:** Imagine you are watching a cricket match. Instead of directly checking the live score repeatedly, you subscribe to a cricket score app on your phone. Now, whenever the score changes, the app sends you a notification. This way, you get updates automatically without constantly checking the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the Observer pattern does: it lets multiple objects (observers) subscribe to another object (subject) so that whenever the subject's state changes, all the observers are notified automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Technical Explanation`:** You have a `Subject` or `Publisher` class that maintains a list of observers in an queue. The `Subject` class has methods to `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` observers. It also has a method to `notify` all the observers when its state changes. Once the observer is notified, it can `pull` the updated data from the subject and process it."

    "\n",
    "- This design pattern is nicely suited for `event handling systems`, `distributed systems`, `message brokers`, etc.\n",
    "- It helps in `reducing coupling` between the objects.\n",
    "- It help in efficiencies since subscribers compete with each other to process the data.\n",
    "- It can be combined with Event driven autoscaling, where the autoscaler can scale subscribers based on the number of events. [`KEDA`](https://keda.sh) is a good example of this.  "
